This is a simple implementation of a flighter jet shooter fighting ominous missiles; its based on the simple game depicted in https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/ with some additions and modifications. The animated assets were taken from https://opengameart.org/, some of them were slightly edited.

Some of the code in this repository is my own work, while other parts of it are based on the blog post mentioned above. I do not claim ownership on any of it and any individual should feel free to do whatever they want with it :)
